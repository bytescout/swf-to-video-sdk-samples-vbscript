```
' x64 IMPORTANT NOTE: set CPU to x86 to build in x86 mode. WHY? Because flash is not supported on x64 platform currently at all

' Create an instance of SWFToVideo ActiveX object
Set converter = CreateObject("BytescoutSWFToVideo.SWFToVideo")

' Set debug log
'converter.SetLogFile "log.txt"

' Register SWFToVideo
converter.RegistrationName = "demo"
converter.RegistrationKey = "demo"

' Set input SWF file
converter.InputSWFFileName = "SlideShowWithEffects.swf"
	
' Set output WMV or AVI video file
converter.OutputVideoFileName = "result.wmv"

' you may calculate output video duration using information about the the source swf movie
' WARNING #1: this method to calculate the output video duration is not working for movies with dynamic scenes 
' and interactive scripts as in these movies it is not possible to calculate the precise duration of the movie 
' WARNING #2: you should set the input swf or flv filename (or url) before this calculation

' So the movie duration is calculated as the following:
' as swf frame count (number of frames in the swf) / movieFPS (frames per second defined in swf)
' and then multiplied by 1000 (as we are setting the .ConverstionTimeout in milliseconds)
' as the following (uncomment if you want to set the length of the output video to the same as the original swf)
' or as the following source code (uncomment to enable):

' converter.ConversionTimeout = 1000 * (converter.FrameCount / converter.MovieFPS)



' Set output movie dimensions
converter.OutputWidth = 640
converter.OutputHeight = 480

' Run conversion
converter.RunAndWait

' Open result in default media player
Set shell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
shell.Run "result.wmv", 1, false
Set shell = Nothing

Set converter = Nothing
